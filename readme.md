# L-scale

Tiny game made for the [2024 GMTK game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024), with the topic "built to scale".

## Running this project

Clone this repo, then [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then do `cargo run --release`.

There are some instrucions in-game, but the point is to create a
[pseudo L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
that avoids touching some blue targets.

The more points and nesting, the higher the score. See how far you can get!
